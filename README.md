Wow, just... phew, Chasing the Wind. Jus walked out and my brain’s still looping like a glitchy video game character stuck in the floor, y’know? Okay, first off, those visuals – like when the storm hit? Unreal. The wind was everyhere, like that time my living room was a popped popcorn explosion but times a million, gusts and all, but still strangely... beautiful, like my cat knocking over dominoes in slo-mo. You know what I mean?

Anyway, that theater was a madhouse, seriously like everyone was camped out doing some guerilla art installation. Sticky floor collecting candy wrappers like a Roomba with its last breath. I kept feeling like maybe I had crumbs on my back, but noo, just my back being crunchy old metal from those chairbacks. 

Ohhhh, and that scene where they’re standing on the rooftop like tiny action figures defying physics – it’s like gravity was just an option, like when you cough up something that should’ve been water but turns out popcorn kernel shape. 

> And that SOUND. It wasn’t just the theatre's subwoofers, I swear, it was like they plugged the wind directly into my brain and cranked the bass to ‘let’s test your dental fillings’ levels. Didn’t someone ask if they could download the movie? Something about wanting to watch the movie on repeat or in their own sound-isolated bunker, idk anymore. 

Anyway, not even sure how they got those angles, like MC Escher started a side gig in cinematography, but without the stairs and more weather, you feel me? I’m sitting here still floored, trying to unstick my jaw from popcorn mode—sweet, fake butter love if I ever knew any.

Randomly reminded me, like, if a goat were narrating just before dropping a mic into a sheep field. Seriously, execution like virtuosic chaotic genius, you’d probably want sum weird interstellar energy to ever shoot that. I’ll probably have vivid dreams of cloud formations doing the Macarena.

I don’t know; let’s just say if you can rent or download the movie, do it. Watch the movie. Feel it. Get swallowed whole, and have your heart do that weird oscillation thing like when you go over a hill too fast.
